# Market-Fit-Research-for-Purifier-Development
"Air Pure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities  ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. In the project I have analysed about the demand of Air purifier by answering some questions asked by the company.
The tool used for EDA is python numpy and pandas.

I have conducted Primary_Analysis using dataset Dataful platform.
And Secondary_Analysis is done using self-researched dataset.
Some Critical Asked questions are also answered.


Tools_used
Python: Used for EDA, understanding about the dataset provided.
MySQL: Used for getting insights in Primary Analysis.
Power Bi: Used for answering some questions and presenting the project.

Key insights:
1. Most polluting particle across India - PM10 & PM2.5.
PM2.5 more dangerous due its ultrafine size due to which it may enter into our bloodstreams.
✨ Insight- The Air Purifier developed should focus on eliminating or reducing these particles as much as possible due to their bad health effects.

2. Top 3 states with nearly irreversible AQI degradation- Kanpur, Patna and Ghaziabad.
✨ Insight- The development & testing of the product should be done in these regions. If product succeed in these regions, it would be a strong product. 

3. Months with worst average AQI- November & January.
✨ Insight- The company marketing team should develop a good strategy to increase the sale of its Air Purifier and capture the market share.

4. Delhi with average AQI of 206.42 Included in the list of top 5 states with high ev adoption.
✨ Insight- Delhi has urgent need for good Air purifiers. The state should not be ignored while developing the product. Health effects in Delhi should be studied in more detail.

5. Major Competitors
hashtag#Livepure- Entry level competitor with price range of Rs 6000 - Rs 12000.
hashtag#Dyson- Premium level competitor with price range of Rs 35000 - Rs 60000. 
✨ Insight-A diverse range of purifiers needs to be developed for different segment of customers. 
Areas with low pollution levels need basic air purifiers and areas with high pollution level need premium level air purifiers with more features.

6. Awareness about AQI and its health implications among Indian citizens
GovtEmployees - most aware (44.80%)
Homemakers - Least aware (29.30%)
✨ Insight- Government employees may become top buyers of Air purifiers
and awareness among homemakers should be created by creating advertisements.

7. Feature gap in existing Air purifiers (almost every product)
Smart home integration, Community sharing, Multi language support.
✨ Insight- They must have features that needs to be integrated before building Air purifiers.

This project was the part of Resume Challange project 16 from Codebasics.
