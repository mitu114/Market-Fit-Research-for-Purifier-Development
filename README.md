# Market-Fit-Research-for-Purifier-Development
"Air Pure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities  ranking among the worldâ€™s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. In the project I have analysed about the demand of Air purifier by answering some questions asked by the company.
